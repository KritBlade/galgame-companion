/* Overlay anti-collapse (galgame upstream structural quirk, proven live 2026-07-16):
   galgame appends #gal-global-overlay as a flex child of ST's #chat (display:flex;
   flex-direction:column) and gives it inline flex-shrink:1 + min-height:0. Immersive mode
   (沉浸模式 / hideNonLastFloors) works by display:none-ing every sibling .mes row, so the
   overlay is the ONLY flex item and keeps its full height. With immersive OFF the message
   floors stay as flex items; flex-shrink:1 + min-height:0 then lets the overlay be squeezed
   to 0px — entering galgame mode activates an INVISIBLE overlay (toast fires, no UI shows).
   We can't edit galgame (imported untouched from CDN); pin the ACTIVE overlay's size so it
   survives the flex squeeze and displays inline (below the chat) even with immersive off.
   Keyed on .active — only present while the overlay is meant to be shown. */
